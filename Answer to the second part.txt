A. Parent = Spell
   Child = Accio and Confundo

b.

-  No description
- Confundus charmConfundo
- Causes the victim to become confused and bufuddled

C. 
- Confundus CharmConfundo
  Causes the victim to become confused bufuddled
- Why? Basically the __init__(seltion, name) will search for a "" signs and if I erase the spell = Accio() 
up to study_spell(spell) it will foucs on the last one which is study_spell(Confundo()) and it 
will automatically locate the class called Confundono and the code will decrypt on its own.
